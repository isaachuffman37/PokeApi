# Overview

In this project I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to pull information from the public pokemon API and display the information in a meaningful way. My wife and I enjoy playing Pokemon Go and like watching the classic Pokemon episodes, so displaying the information of a pokemon just by typing in the name and clicking a button is very convenient. This program uses the built in fetch method within an async function to grab the infromation of the pokemon that you type in. Then, the displayData function manipulates that data and inserts it into the html for us to see. I also needed to add an event listener to the JavaScript file so that my project would not try to execute the main functions before the user clicked the button.  

The purpose of this project was to further understand how to interact with the DOM and how to get data from an api and interact with it in a JSON format. I learned more about how "async/await" functions work and how the order of manipulating the DOM plays into using those functions. I also learned how to use user input to interact with an API as well. This project has really helped me understand more of what goes into developing an interactive web page with using a database for the backend.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- learn how to do a POST request usingt the fetch api as well
- Improve the flexability of how the program handles user input so that they don't have to be exact
- Make the front end more interactive and dsiplay errors to the user, not just the console
